# Active Directory Home Lab Environment

## Project Overview
This project consists of a simulated corporate IT infrastructure designed to mimic a real-world Help Desk environment. The goal was to build a domain network from scratch, configure a Domain Controller, and manage users and workstations to simulate day-to-day IT support tasks.

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
* **Hypervisor:** Oracle VirtualBox
* **Server OS:** Windows Server 2022 (Desktop Experience)
* **Client OS:** Windows 11 Enterprise
* **Network:** Bridged Adapter Configuration with Static IP Addressing
* **Core Services:** Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), DNS, DHCP

## 🏗 Architecture & Configuration
I configured a private virtual network where the Windows Server acts as the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) and DNS server for the Windows 11 client.

### 1. Network Configuration
* **Server IP:** `192.168.0.200` (Static)
* **Client DNS:** Pointed to Server (`192.168.0.200`) to enable domain resolution.
* **Verification:** Successfully verified connectivity via ICMP (Ping) before attempting domain join.

### 2. Active Directory Deployment
* Promoted Windows Server 2022 to a Domain Controller.
* Created a new forest: `corp.local`.
* Configured a dedicated Organizational Unit (OU) structure for departmental management (e.g., Marketing, HR).

### 3. Client Onboarding
* Provisioned a Windows 11 Enterprise workstation.
* Joined the workstation to the `corp.local` domain.
* Verified the "Handshake" between client and server via successful domain login.

## 🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Infrastructure Setup:** Installing and configuring Windows Server in a virtualized environment.
* **Networking:** Understanding Subnetting, Static IPs, and DNS resolution.
* **Troubleshooting:** Diagnosing connectivity issues between VMs on different subnets.
* **Administration:** User account creation, password management, and security policy implementation.

## 🔜 Next Steps
* Implementing Group Policy Objects (GPO) to manage desktop backgrounds and security settings.
* Simulating Help Desk tickets (Password Resets, Account Lockouts).
